                The primary goals of the Hydroponic Horticulture Facility are to establish a premier training and 
                research hub, empower aspiring entrepreneurs and local farmers with the skills needed to set up, 
                operate, and maintain hydroponic horticulture systems, focus on researching and developing 
                innovative hydroponic cultivation methods for new horticultural crops, and build an ecosystem 
                that significantly contributes to pollution control, water conservation, and the supply of fresh, 
                healthy produce to the local community.
